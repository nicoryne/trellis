## What is Trellis?

Trellis is a two-layer knowledge platform for law firms. It captures individual lawyer expertise locally, governs its publication into a shared team knowledge graph with AI-assisted redaction, and makes the accumulated intelligence queryable via a citation-grounded chatbot with a signature graph-overlay visualization.

**The problem:** Law firms lose an estimated $15M–$40M annually to knowledge fragmentation, redundant work, and institutional memory loss when senior lawyers depart. Attorney-client privilege structurally blocks adoption of generic AI tools.

**The solution:** A personal brain (local, private) where lawyers capture thinking throughout the day, paired with a team-managed knowledge graph (governed cloud) where sanitized insights are published and retrievable by the entire practice group.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Multimodal Capture** | Text, audio (Whisper transcription), and image (Gemini Vision OCR) note intake |
| **AI Auto-Organization** | Gemini extracts entities, classifies notes, and builds a personal knowledge graph |
| **Privacy-First Publishing** | Two-pass redaction pipeline (Presidio PII tokenization + Gemini generalization) with side-by-side diff review |
| **Team Knowledge Graph** | Governed, queryable graph of the practice group's accumulated intelligence |
| **Citation-Grounded Chat** | RAG-powered retrieval over the team graph; every claim cites a source node |
| **Query-Overlay Visualization** | Signature visual moment — chat dims, team graph fades in, cited nodes pulse as the answer streams |
| **Pluggable Brain (V1)** | MCP server endpoint so external AI tools (Harvey, CoCounsel, Copilot) can query the firm's knowledge |

## Tech Stack (MVP)

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Cytoscape.js |
| Backend | Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16, pgvector |
| AI | Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash/Vision, Whisper API, Microsoft Presidio |
| Personal Storage | IndexedDB (browser) |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend + Postgres) |

## Target Market

**Initial wedge:** Litigation practice groups at mid-size law firms (50–300 lawyers).

**Expansion path:** Other practice groups → BigLaw / AmLaw 200 → In-house legal teams → Adjacent professional services.

**Business model:** Practice-group license, tiered by size ($25K–$85K ARR), with land-and-expand across the firm (~$200K ARR at maturity).

## Hackathon Context

Built for the **AI & Big Data Expo Lablab Hackathon** — Track 4: Data & Intelligence. Competing for the **Gemini Award** (Gemini powers extraction, redaction, and synthesis throughout).

**Demo narrative (5 min):** Capture → Publish with visible redaction → Retrieval with graph-overlay visualization.

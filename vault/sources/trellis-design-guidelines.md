# Trellis · Design Guidelines

> Source file: [`raw/design-guidelines.md`](../raw/design-guidelines.md)

## One-line summary

How Trellis looks, reads, and moves. Dark mode primary, GitHub-classic neutrals with **orange `#fb8500`** accent (revised from amber-gold `#d4a72c` on 2026-05-14), Source Serif Pro for body and Inter for UI, force-directed graphs as the spine, motion subtle except for the [[query-overlay-animation]] which is deliberately slow.

## Why it's here

The visual and verbal language of the product. Anchors [[trellis-design-system]] and the three [[hero-moments]] pages.

## Key claims

- **Brand personality**: modern, sleek, minimal, confident, institutional, intelligent. Not playful. No emoji in microcopy. No exclamation points.
- **Reference points (in priority order)**: [[harvey|Harvey]] (legal credibility, dark restrained), [[notion|Notion]] (density, structured editing), [[obsidian|Obsidian]] (graph aesthetic).
- **Theme**: dark mode primary. Light mode is V2.
- **Palette**: GitHub-classic dark neutrals + **orange accent (`#fb8500`)**, hover `#ff9d2a`, muted `#8a4900`, bg-tint `#2d1a06`. Semantic palette: success `#3fb950`, warning `#d29922`, danger `#f85149`, info `#58a6ff`. (Accent revised from amber-gold `#d4a72c` on 2026-05-14 — see [[log]].)
- **Strict rule**: [[node-color-coding|graph node colors]] never overlap with accent or semantic palettes. Keeps data distinct from UI signals.
- **Typography**: Source Serif Pro (body, headings), Inter (UI/nav/labels), JetBrains Mono (citation IDs, metadata). Avoid 800/900 weights.
- **Spacing**: 4px scale; Tailwind defaults. Density philosophy: spacious when consuming, dense when producing/scanning.
- **Primary breakpoint**: 1280px (typical lawyer's laptop).
- **Voice**: direct, clear, no apology-cute, no marketing exuberance. "Note saved" not "Yay!"
- **Iconography**: Lucide outlined; sizes 16/20/24px, no fractional scaling.
- **Motion durations**: fast 150ms, default 250ms, slow 400ms, deliberate 600–800ms (only for [[query-overlay-animation]]). Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Three [[hero-moments]]**:
  1. **Publish flow with redaction** — side-by-side diff modal, preservation score bar, hoverable connecting curves between matched redaction pairs.
  2. **Chat with citations** — inline monospace `[1]` chips, sources section collapsed for high-confidence answers, refusal state fully designed.
  3. **Query-overlay graph animation** — chat dims, full-screen graph overlay, cited nodes pulse in rank order, then overlay fades back as response streams.
- **Component patterns**: buttons (primary/secondary/tertiary/destructive/icon-only), inputs (focus ring `accent-primary`), cards (`bg-surface`, 6px radius), modals (no blur for standard; blur reserved for query overlay), toasts (slide in bottom-right), citation chip (monospace, `accent-primary-bg` background), graph node (24px → 32px on selection).
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA baseline; voice control as first-class.
- **Out of scope for design [MVP]**: Knowledge Admin dashboard, approval workflow UI, light theme, settings page, account switching, mobile-native UI.
- **Design tokens file**: ready to drop into `apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`.

## Pages this source materially changed

- [[trellis-design-system]] — created (synthesis page consolidating all design tokens)
- [[hero-moments]] — created
- [[query-overlay-animation]] — refined with frame-by-frame choreography
- [[node-color-coding]] — created with the strict-non-overlap rule
- [[trellis]] — brand personality bullet added

## Re-ingest 2026-05-14 — accent color revision

Accent palette swapped from amber-gold to orange. Concrete changes:

| Token | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `accent-primary` | `#d4a72c` | `#fb8500` |
| `accent-primary-hover` | (n/a) | `#ff9d2a` |
| `accent-primary-muted` | (n/a) | `#8a4900` |
| `accent-primary-bg` | (legacy tint) | `#2d1a06` |
| Section 2.3 header | "Accent palette (amber/gold for institutional credibility)" | "Accent palette (orange for institutional credibility)" |
| Strict-rule wording (§2.5) | "no graph node color may overlap with the accent palette (gold/amber)" | "no graph node color may overlap with the accent palette (orange)" |
| `--node-witness` | `#ff9f1c` | `#ffd60a` (saffron — was too close to new orange accent) |
| `--node-statute` | `#fb5607` | `#d62828` (crimson — was too close to new orange accent) |

Propagated to: [[node-color-coding]] (palette rule + cited-edge color), [[query-overlay-animation]] (cited-edge illumination), [[insight-preservation-score]] (dot color label), [[hero-moments]] (confidence pill, preservation bar labels), [[rag-query-pipeline]] (confidence pill description), [[trellis-design-system]] (accent table + section heading), [[trellis-implementation-plan]] (G-2 active-state description), [[trellis-govern-implementation]] (token value), [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]] (cited-edge illumination). `raw/design-guidelines.md` and `raw/context-dump.md` left as-is per the immutability rule.

## Contradictions or tensions

> ⚠ Density philosophy: "Spacious for consuming, dense for producing/scanning" implies the chat surface (consuming) should be spacious — but chat history is dense by default in most modern apps. The doc lists chat under "dense working surfaces." Resolved: chat history is dense; the redaction modal (a consuming/deciding moment) is spacious.

## Open questions raised

- Light theme is V2; what is the trigger? Customer request, regulatory accessibility requirement, both?
- "Voice control as a first-class feature" is asserted under accessibility — what's the V1 implementation scope vs. V2?
- The signature [[query-overlay-animation]] reads as expensive on lower-end machines. What is the fallback above and beyond `prefers-reduced-motion`?

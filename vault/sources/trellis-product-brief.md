# Trellis · Product Brief

> Source file: [`raw/product-brief.md`](../raw/product-brief.md)

## Re-ingest note (2026-05-12)

Two meaningful diffs from the original brief:

1. **Business model section rewritten**: from *"Firm-wide license, tiered by firm size"* ($50K/$90K/$150K for 50–100 / 100–200 / 200–300 lawyers) → to *"**Practice-group license**, tiered by practice-group size"* ($25K/$50K/$85K for 10–25 / 25–50 / 50–100 litigators). Adds explicit **land-and-expand** framing with ~$200K ARR per firm at maturity. See [[trellis-business-model]].
2. **Target customer section reframed**: from *"Primary target: mid-size firms"* → to *"**Initial wedge**: mid-size firms"*, with an explicit expansion path (other practice groups → BigLaw → in-house legal → adjacent professional services) and a candid note on BigLaw fit (architecture supports it; GTM motion is what changes).

SAM math updated accordingly: ~$50K initial ACV per practice group → **$150M–$250M wedge SAM**.

The rest of the brief is identical to the original ingest. The product, architecture, and demo are unchanged.

## One-line summary

The canonical pitch for [[trellis]]: a privacy-first knowledge fabric for law firms that turns accumulated expertise into a queryable, governable, pluggable intelligence layer.

## Why it's here

Defines what Trellis is, who it's for, and why it wins. Anchors every entity and concept page that derives from product positioning.

## Key claims

- **The problem**: law firms lose institutional intelligence when lawyers leave; lawyers don't document because they bill in six-minute increments; [[attorney-client-privilege]] blocks public AI tools; existing legal AI is point solutions.
- **Estimated cost**: an AmLaw 200 firm loses **$15M–$40M annually** to knowledge fragmentation; senior partner departures can cost 5–10% of practice revenue.
- **The product**: a two-layer platform — **personal brain (local, private)** and **team-managed knowledge graph (governed cloud)** — surfaced through three graph views: personal, team-admin, and query-overlay.
- **The two-layer split**: privileged content never leaves the device unsanitized; the team layer holds only sanitized published insights.
- **The pluggable brain (V1)**: an MCP server endpoint exposes the team graph to Harvey, internal builds, Microsoft Copilot. *Trellis is the substrate that makes the rest of the firm's AI stack work.*
- **Scope discipline**: hackathon MVP vs V1 vs V2 is the most important section of the document.
- **Target customer (wedge, not ceiling)**: litigation practice groups in mid-size firms (50–300 lawyers). Buyer is the **[[knowledge-admin|KM Partner / KM Director]]**. Expansion path is structural: other practice groups → BigLaw → in-house legal → adjacent professional services. (revised 2026-05-12)
- **Market sizing**: TAM 175,000+ firms globally; **wedge SAM** at ~$50K initial ACV per practice group = **$150M–$250M**; SOM 2–5% of SAM in 3–5 years = $3M–$37M ARR. Full-firm penetration over years pushes meaningfully higher.
- **Business model**: **practice-group license**, tiered by practice-group size; **land-and-expand** to adjacent groups within firms; no per-seat. (revised 2026-05-12 from firm-wide license — see [[trellis-business-model]] and [[trellis-decision-history]] Phase 11)
- **Demo narrative**: capture → privacy/redaction → retrieval with graph overlay → preservation framing. Five minutes.
- **Why it wins the hackathon**: clearly enterprise, clearly AI-native, hits all four focus areas of Track 4 (Data & Intelligence), qualifies for the Gemini Award, demoable in five minutes.

## Contradictions or tensions

> ⚠ MVP simplification: the brief states published knowledge "auto-flows into the team graph (no Knowledge Admin approval step)" in MVP, while the [[knowledge-admin]] role exists in the data model. The PRD ([[trellis-product-requirements]]) reconciles this: the role exists but has the same permissions as Lawyer in MVP.

## Open questions raised

- Honest read on TAM: "Not a billion-dollar standalone market in three years by itself." Adjacent verticals (corporate legal, in-house teams, expert services) extend the trajectory — but at what timeline and capital cost?
- Sales cycles of 3–9 months for mid-size firms; partnership channels needed for the bottom end of SAM. Which partners?

# When does index-only retrieval stop being enough for this vault?

## Status

**Open** — awaiting Keith's answer.

## Why it matters

The [[llm-wiki-pattern|pattern]] asserts that index-only retrieval (reading `index.md` first to find candidate pages, then drilling in) works at "~100 sources, hundreds of pages." This vault has 6 sources and ~80 pages today. The threshold matters because once it's crossed, the agent needs a proper search tool (qmd, pgvector, or vibe-coded) and the workflow changes. (see [[llm-wiki-pattern]])

## What we know so far

- Karpathy's heuristic: ~100 sources, hundreds of pages.
- This vault: 6 sources, ~80 pages.
- Plenty of headroom; not a near-term concern.

## What would resolve it

- A pragmatic trigger: "when index.md exceeds ~200 entries OR when the agent's response time on a query becomes noticeable, install qmd."
- Note the threshold and revisit when it's hit.

## Answer

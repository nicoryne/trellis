# Ethical wall — what happens when a query would cite a walled node?

## Status

**Open** — awaiting Keith's answer.

## Why it matters

The [[rag-query-pipeline]] retrieves top-k nodes by cosine similarity then expands 1 hop. If one of those nodes is walled off from the querying lawyer, the system has to decide between three behaviors — each with different UX, audit, and inference-leak properties: (see [[ethical-wall]], [[attorney-client-privilege]])

- **Refuse**: respond as if no node existed for this lawyer.
- **Redact-and-cite-anonymously**: include the insight, hide identifying details, log the suppression.
- **Silently drop**: filter the walled node out of context before synthesis; lawyer never sees it referenced.

Each choice has audit and inference-leak implications (e.g. silent drop is auditable but could leak "something exists here" via retrieval timing).

## What we know so far

- Walls are inherited from external conflicts systems (V2 spec).
- The retrieval pipeline currently has no filter step.
- No UX has been designed for the walled-cite case.

## What would resolve it

- A documented behavior (likely "silent drop, log denied read") with audit-log support.
- A UI affordance for the case where retrieval comes back empty after wall filtering.

## [2026-05-14] note | Audio transcription migrated from Whisper to Gemini Flash

`POST /api/transcribe` now calls `gemini-2.5-flash` with `inlineData` (base64 WebM/Opus) instead of the OpenAI Whisper API (`whisper-1`). The `openai` npm package was removed from `apps/api/package.json`. Response contract is unchanged: `{ data: { transcript: string } }`. The full capture flow (state machine, editable transcript, organize-on-save, IDB storage) is unaffected. Pages updated: [[whisper]], [[trellis-capture-implementation]].

## [2026-05-14] ingest | Brand + chat/graph polish (commits `54120e7` + `ad3e14c`)

Two commits landed substantial UI work. **(1) Brand surface**: new `Logo.tsx` component (`<img>` rendering `/trellis-logo.png`, scalable via `size` prop), favicon wired in `index.html`, Logo placed in TopNav (size 22), LoginView (size 56, staggered choreography with drop-shadow glow), ChatView welcome (size 56) and assistant avatars (size 20), PersonalGraphView empty state (size 64). New `--accent-primary-rgb: 251, 133, 0` token enables `rgba(var(...), α)` filter usage. The accent rebrand also revised two node colors that conflicted with the new orange: `witness` `#ff9f1c` → `#ffd60a` (saffron) and `statute` `#fb5607` → `#d62828` (crimson) — propagated to [[node-color-coding]] and [[trellis-design-system]] and noted in [[trellis-design-guidelines]]'s re-ingest table.

**(2) Chat surface**: new [[trellis-retrieval-implementation|CitationChip]] (motion-spring hover, accent-orange styling, keyboard-operable) and [[trellis-retrieval-implementation|ConfidenceBadge]] (four states: high / medium / low / refuse with dot-fill metaphor, semantic palette colors). Refusal CTA "Capture your thinking on this" routes to `/capture`. Chat dim-cascade isolation: `.chat-content` wrapper carries the dim state so the overlay + sidepanel render above the cascade at full opacity.

**(3) Graph surface**: created [[graph-zoom-control]] concept page — new persistent widget (`GraphZoomControl.tsx` + CSS, commit `ad3e14c`), bottom-right anchor, 20–150% range slider with gradient fill, fit-to-view reset (`Maximize2` icon). Adaptive label visibility at `LABEL_ZOOM_THRESHOLD = 0.75`. Wired into both PersonalGraphView and TeamGraphView. Updated [[cytoscape-js]], [[trellis-capture-implementation]].

**(4) Query overlay refinements** ([[query-overlay-animation]], [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]]): explicit phase tracking (`'in' | 'hold' | 'out'`), status label "Searching firm knowledge" with animated dots, "ESC to dismiss" hint, edge reveal gated on both endpoints lit, halo glow on cited nodes at progress > 0.4. Timing constants captured: `FADE_IN_MS = 400`, `PULSE_STAGGER_MS = 150`, `PULSE_DURATION_MS = 300`, `FADE_OUT_MS = 600`. Canvas-based architecture confirmed stable.

The Logo component was *not* given its own entity page — it's an implementation detail surfaced wherever brand consistency is needed; references go directly to [[trellis-logo]] as a wikilink-only stub for now.

## [2026-05-14] ingest | Design guidelines re-ingest — accent color revised from amber-gold to orange

User updated `.agent/design-guidelines.md` §2.3 + §13: accent palette swapped from `#d4a72c` (amber/gold) to `#fb8500` (orange), with new hover `#ff9d2a`, muted `#8a4900`, bg-tint `#2d1a06`. Strict-rule wording in §2.5 also updated ("amber/gold" → "orange"). Propagated to: [[trellis-design-guidelines]] (source page — added re-ingest section with before/after table), [[trellis-design-system]] (accent table + lead sentence), [[node-color-coding]] (palette overlap rule, cited-edge color, "if a user sees X in the graph" paragraph), [[query-overlay-animation]] (cited-edge illumination), [[trellis-implementation-plan]] (G-2 nav active-state), [[trellis-govern-implementation]] (accent token value), [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]] (cited-edge illumination).

**Important distinction**: many "amber" references in the vault refer to the `warning` semantic color (`#d29922`), not the accent. Those were *not* changed: the preservation-score medium dot ([[insight-preservation-score]]), the confidence pill ([[rag-query-pipeline]], [[hero-moments]]), and similar semantic-color usages remain amber. Clarifying notes added inline. The semantic palette is unaffected by this revision.

`raw/design-guidelines.md` and `raw/context-dump.md` left as-is per the immutability rule for `raw/`; the historical mentions of "amber/gold" survive there as a snapshot of the v1 spec.

## [2026-05-14] ingest | Main-branch sync — seed analysis source, derived edges, embedding-model correction, UI polish

10 new commits since `a23e4e8`. Major adds: (1) **New source** — `.agent/seed_data_analysis.md` ingested as [[trellis-seed-data-analysis]]; confirms 20 insights / 3 demo users / 6 personal notes, all idempotent, with the canonical demo query. (2) **New concept** — [[derived-edges]] documenting the four-phase Obsidian-style connection feature in `seed/deriveEdges.ts`: shared-entity (≥2, weight `min(s/3,1)`), classification hub (Phase 2, new `classification` node type, diamond visual), embedding similarity (>0.80), entity co-occurrence (≥2, weight `min(c/4,1)`). Edge styling: `mentions` solid 0.35, `about` dotted 0.15, `related_to` dashed `[4,3]` 0.25.

(3) **Embedding model correction** (commits `0164277` + `b522b13`): implementation uses **`gemini-embedding-001`** with `outputDimensionality: 768`, NOT the spec's `text-embedding-004` (not exposed by `@google/generative-ai` SDK). Updated [[gemini]] entity page; replaced inline `text-embedding-004` references in [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]], [[trellis-govern-implementation]], [[trellis-implementation-plan]], [[acme-litigation-partners]]. Added a 2026-05-14 addendum to [[embedding-model-migration-path]] noting that pinning `outputDimensionality` to the schema column is a cheap partial mitigation — the full migration strategy is still open.

(4) **UI polish** (commits `5b5336d` + `1c836dd`): personal graph now uses **`cola` continuous force-directed physics** (not `cose`), built on a direct `cytoscape` instance with hover-neighbor highlighting and tap-to-open. Chat view got a welcome state (greets by first name, 4 suggested queries), thinking-dots indicator, per-message timestamps, avatar icons. SideNav split into "Personal" / "Team" sections; TopNav shows a role badge. LoginView added subtitle, error icon, footer tagline, fade-in animation, glow. Captured in [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]], [[trellis-govern-implementation]], [[trellis-capture-implementation]], [[cytoscape-js]].

(5) **Chat URL plumbing** (commit `1035b67`): `routes/chat.ts` mounts the handler at `/` (the router itself is mounted at `/api/chat` from `index.ts`, so the public endpoint is unchanged). All five service entry points now load `.env.local` with `override: true` for local-secret precedence over `.env`. Not load-bearing for the vault.

## [2026-05-14] note | Working-tree polish (uncommitted) — 3 spec deviations closed or partially closed

Same HEAD commit, but uncommitted changes across capture views and RedactionModal. Three meaningful additions: (1) **per-redaction Restore / Re-apply toggle** in `RedactionModal.tsx` (new details accordion, rebuilds sanitized text from a `rejectedSet`, `canPublish` now also true on `hasRejections`) — partially closes the spec deviation about "per-redaction accept/modify/reject"; (2) **AudioCapture and ImageCapture now run `organizeNote` on save** (gated by extracted-text length > 20 chars) — previously text-only, now all three capture types run the auto-organization pipeline as the PRD requires; (3) **entity-chip "×" remove button** in TextCapture wired to a new `noteStore.removeEntity(noteId, entityId)` method — satisfies the PRD acceptance criterion "Lawyer can manually correct any extraction error (edit chips, add/remove entities)." Updated [[trellis-govern-implementation]], [[trellis-capture-implementation]], [[redaction-pipeline]]. Font stack adjustment in `tokens.css` (added Source Serif Pro as primary serif fallback before Source Serif 4) is too minor to record in concept pages.

## [2026-05-14] ingest | GOVERN + RETRIEVAL domains merged into main

Massive rebase brought in 36 commits across both domains. All 16 remaining tickets (G-1–G-8, N-1–N-8) shipped. Created [[trellis-govern-implementation]] and [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]] (topics). Updated [[redaction-pipeline]], [[rag-query-pipeline]], [[query-overlay-animation]], [[insight-preservation-score]] with implementation sections. Updated entities [[microsoft-presidio]] (port 5001/5002, Docker images, regex fallback), [[postgres-pgvector]] (image `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`, edge uniqueness + cascade, tables shipped vs. spec), [[acme-litigation-partners]] (real demo names Ana Mendoza / Carlos Reyes / Diana Santos, 20 published insights with topic breakdown). Marked G and N tickets ✓ in [[trellis-implementation-plan]].

**Key deviations from spec captured in the vault**: (1) preservation score is **5 dots, not 0–100% bar**; (2) redaction modal connecting curves not implemented (intentional trim); (3) query overlay is **canvas-based, not Cytoscape-rendered** — perceptual effect preserved via opacity + glow rather than per-node scale pulse; (4) RAG graph expansion only adds `insight`-type neighbors to context, not entity neighbors; (5) refusal message exact text changed from spec; (6) demo accounts have real fictional names (Mendoza/Reyes/Santos), not generic role labels.

**Audit fixes worth recording as cautionary patterns**: package.json `type: module` regression broke Vite ESM; Zustand referential equality requires immutable updates (shallow-spread + mutate fails); `Math.random()` inside a canvas render loop causes per-frame jitter (use deterministic seeded variants); `tsc` does not copy `.md` or `.sql` files to `dist/` — postbuild `shx cp` step required. (see [[trellis-retrieval-implementation]])

## [2026-05-13] ingest | CAPTURE domain implementation (K-1 through K-8)

Extracted from 27 git commits on the `keith` branch. All 8 CAPTURE tickets are complete — including K-4 (image capture, which was a P1 droppable contingency but shipped). Key new facts: `gemini-2.5-pro` confirmed as organize model; structured output via Gemini SDK `responseSchema` (not prompt-only); confidence threshold is **0.5** (not 0.6 as previously stated in the wiki — corrected). Personal seed is exactly 6 notes with 17 entities, 3 privileged / 3 non-privileged. Cytoscape layout is **`cose`** (not generic force-directed). Created [[trellis-capture-implementation]] (topic). Updated [[auto-organization-pipeline]] (entity types table, implementation section, confidence threshold correction), [[cytoscape-js]] (cose layout, file path), [[node-color-coding]] (implementation confirmation, edge hex values), [[acme-litigation-partners]] (6-note seed table with entity breakdown), [[trellis-implementation-plan]] (K tickets marked ✓). Index updated.

## [2026-05-13] ingest | Codebase structure after main-branch merge

Explored four new directories introduced by merging main: `apps/`, `.agent/`, `infra/`, `docs/`. Two new sources in `.agent/`: `trellis_implementation_plan.md` (25-ticket sprint board, 3 devs) and `trellis-vault-assistant.md` (Claude system prompt for vault-grounded queries). Created [[trellis-implementation-plan]] (source + topic), [[trellis-codebase-structure]] (topic), and [[trellis-vault-assistant]] (entity). Updated [[index.md]] with 4 new entries. Key new facts: Keith=CAPTURE, Gabe=GOVERN, Nicolo=RETRIEVAL; vertical-slice file ownership; Day 0 bootstrap; daily merge order Nicolo→Gabe→Keith; 6 contingency plans; `apps/web/src/views/{auth,capture,chat,graph,publish,team}/` and `apps/api/src/{routes,services,db,prompts,seed}/` directory structure.

## [2026-05-12] note | Answered 5 questions (first batch)

Answered: [[acme-seed-voice-tone]], [[practice-group-lead-mvp-distinctiveness]], [[demo-off-script-query-handling]], [[cytoscape-webgl-vs-canvas]], [[react-vite-bundle-size-budget]]. Partially answered [[v1-seed-strategy-at-firm-onboarding]] for the MVP-demo scope (V1 customer-onboarding still open). Propagated to [[acme-litigation-partners]] (added seed corpus = PH laws/articles/cases, seed voice, backup-query coverage as key facts), [[practice-group-lead]] (replaced ⚠ demo-risk callout with the rehearsed talk-track), [[cytoscape-js]] (canvas renderer + lazy-load note), [[react-vite]] (full bundle-budget section), [[trellis-demo-narrative]] (new refusal segment + seed-corpus + backup-query design constraints). Index marked with ✓ and ◐ status indicators.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Product Brief + Context Dump (business-model revision)

Re-ingested `raw/product-brief.md` and `raw/context-dump.md`. Material change: **business model flipped from firm-wide license to practice-group license with land-and-expand**, and target customer reframed from "primary target" to **"wedge, not ceiling"** with an explicit expansion path (other practice groups → BigLaw → in-house legal → adjacent professional services). New pricing tiers: $25K/$50K/$85K for 10–25 / 25–50 / 50–100 litigators; ~$200K ARR per firm at maturity. The context dump adds **Phase 11** documenting the reasoning. Heavy rewrite of [[trellis-business-model]]; updates to [[trellis]], [[knowledge-admin]], [[trellis-v1-roadmap]] pricing tiers, [[trellis-decision-history]] (Phase 11 added), [[trellis-rejected-ideas]] (firm-wide license added to the list), and re-ingest notes on both source pages. Product, architecture, and demo are unchanged.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Context Dump

Major new source. Ingested `raw/context-dump.md` as [[trellis-context-dump]]. Created 5 new entities ([[stratum]], [[lobster-trap]], [[veea]], [[rewind-ai]], [[lablab]]), 2 new concepts ([[adoption-strategy]], [[ethical-wall]]), and 2 new topics ([[trellis-decision-history]], [[trellis-rejected-ideas]]). Updated [[trellis]] (codename history + decision-history backlink), [[harvey]] ($3B in 2025 framing), [[gemini]] (Gemini API direct, not via AI Studio — the Lablab requirement was relaxed mid-session), [[two-layer-architecture]] (collapsed from three layers historical note), [[legal-ai-landscape]] (Rewind.ai rejected-reference note), [[hackathon-judging-fit]] (Path A vs Path B decision on Lobster Trap, plus the 4/2 day time split), [[trellis-mvp-scope]] (time budget). Index and frontmatter `sources:` lists updated.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Project Architecture (re-ingest)

Re-ingested `raw/project-architecture.md` after a minor refresh. Only meaningful diff: §2.4 AI Services row for [[gemini]] changed from "Google AI Studio / Gemini API" to just "Gemini API" — Trellis calls the Gemini API directly. Eligibility for the Gemini Award is unchanged. Source page [[trellis-project-architecture]] updated with a re-ingest note.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Design Guidelines

Ingested `raw/design-guidelines.md` as [[trellis-design-guidelines]]. Created [[trellis-design-system]] topic page consolidating color, type, spacing, motion, and component patterns. Pulled [[hero-moments]], [[query-overlay-animation]], [[node-color-coding]] as concept pages. Updated [[trellis]] entity page to reference brand personality and tone. Index and frontmatter `sources:` lists updated.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Project Architecture

Ingested `raw/project-architecture.md` as [[trellis-project-architecture]]. Created [[trellis-tech-stack]], [[trellis-data-model]], [[trellis-ai-pipelines]], [[trellis-api-surface]] topic pages. Created [[postgres-pgvector]], [[react-vite]], [[tauri]], [[microsoft-presidio]], [[cytoscape-js]], [[gemma]], [[whisper]], [[gemini]] entity pages. Created [[auto-organization-pipeline]], [[rag-query-pipeline]], [[local-first-architecture]], [[mcp-server]] concept pages. Refined [[redaction-pipeline]] with two-pass MVP and four-pass V1 specifics.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Product Requirements

Ingested `raw/product-requirements.md` as [[trellis-product-requirements]]. Created [[litigator]], [[practice-group-lead]], [[knowledge-admin]] entity (persona) pages and [[trellis-mvp-scope]], [[trellis-v1-roadmap]], [[trellis-v2-vision]], [[trellis-demo-narrative]] topic pages. Added [[citation-grounding]], [[insight-preservation-score]], [[knowledge-graph-extraction]] concepts. Cross-linked acceptance criteria to feature concepts.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Trellis Product Brief

Ingested `raw/product-brief.md` as [[trellis-product-brief]]. Created [[trellis]] entity page (the product), [[acme-litigation-partners]] (demo firm), [[harvey]], [[spellbook]], [[cocounsel]], [[glean]], [[notion]], [[imanage]], [[netdocuments]] (competitive map and integration targets). Created [[two-layer-architecture]], [[three-graph-views]], [[pluggable-brain]], [[attorney-client-privilege]] concepts. Created [[legal-ai-landscape]], [[trellis-business-model]], [[competitive-moat]], [[hackathon-judging-fit]] topics.

## [2026-05-12] ingest | Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern

First source. Ingested `raw/llm-wiki-pattern.md` as [[karpathy-llm-wiki-pattern]]. Established the pattern this vault implements: three layers (raw / wiki / schema), three operations (ingest / query / lint), and the index/log conventions. Created [[llm-wiki-pattern]] (concept), [[memex]] (concept, historical context), [[rag]] (concept, contrast), [[obsidian]] (entity). Initialized [[CLAUDE.md]] schema, [[index.md]], this log, and all templates from this source.

## [2026-05-12] note | vault initialized

Bootstrap. Created directory structure, schema file, index, log, and templates. Ready to ingest sources.

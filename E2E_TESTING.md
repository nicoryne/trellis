# Trellis · End-to-End Testing Guide

**Document type:** Manual E2E test plan
**Audience:** Anyone signing off on the hackathon MVP demo
**Status:** v1
**Companion documents:** [.agent/product-requirements.md](.agent/product-requirements.md), [.agent/project-architecture.md](.agent/project-architecture.md), [.agent/design-guidelines.md](.agent/design-guidelines.md)

## 0. How to use this guide

This is the **demo-readiness gate**. The MVP is "done" when every checkbox in **§9 Master acceptance checklist** is ticked. Any unchecked box blocks the demo.

**Conventions**

- Every test names its **failure mode** explicitly — if the failure-mode happens, the test fails even if no explicit assertion mentions it.
- Steps are written in the imperative ("Click X"). The reviewer performs the step.
- Every test ends with a sub-list of `- [ ]` acceptance criteria. Tick them as you verify.
- File path links point to the code that implements the behavior. If a test fails, open that file first.
- `[MVP]` features MUST pass for the hackathon demo. `[Shipped]` are extras that exist in code but were not in the PRD — they must still work, since users will encounter them.
- A blocked test (e.g. backend not running, no Gemini key) is **not** a pass. Mark it `[ ] BLOCKED — reason` and treat it as a fail until resolved.

**Time budget for a full pass:** roughly 60–90 minutes for one reviewer.

---

## 1. Pre-flight setup

Run this section once before the test pass. If any item fails, fix it before going further.

### 1.1 Required services

| Service | Where | How to confirm |
|---|---|---|
| Postgres 16 + pgvector + uuid-ossp | local Docker or hosted | `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension"` shows `vector` and `uuid-ossp` |
| Microsoft Presidio (analyzer + anonymizer) | `infra/docker-compose.yml` | `curl http://localhost:5001/health` → 200 |
| API server | `cd apps/api && npm run dev` | `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health` → `{"data":{"status":"healthy", ...}}` |
| Web app | `cd apps/web && npm run dev` | `http://localhost:5173` loads the login page |

### 1.2 Required environment variables

`apps/api/.env` must contain:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=...
GEMINI_API_KEY=<real key — needed for organize, vision, redact, embeddings, chat>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<real key — for /api/transcribe if Whisper is enabled>
PRESIDIO_ANALYZER_URL=http://localhost:5001
PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZER_URL=http://localhost:5002
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Failure mode:** if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing or invalid, `/api/organize`, `/api/vision`, `/api/redact`, `/api/publish` (needs embedding), and `/api/chat` all return 500. The seed script also fails. The Presidio fallback regex still works without a key.

`apps/web/.env` (or `.env.local`):

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 1.3 Seed verification

After running `cd apps/api && npm run seed` (idempotent):

```bash
# 3 demo users
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT email, role FROM users ORDER BY email"
# Expect: admin@acme.law (knowledge_admin), lead@acme.law (practice_group_lead), litigator@acme.law (lawyer)

# 15+ insights with embeddings
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) AS insights, COUNT(embedding) AS with_embedding FROM team_graph_nodes WHERE node_type='insight'"
# Expect: both columns ≥ 15

# Canonical-query insights present
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT title FROM team_graph_nodes WHERE title ILIKE '%damages expert%' OR title ILIKE '%counsel-supplied%'"
# Expect: ≥ 2 rows
```

**Acceptance**
- [ ] All three demo accounts seeded with correct emails and roles
- [ ] ≥ 15 insights in `team_graph_nodes` with non-NULL `embedding`
- [ ] ≥ 2 insights matching the canonical damages-expert query
- [ ] Personal sidebar shows 5–8 pre-seeded notes after first lawyer login ([seedPersonal.ts](apps/web/src/lib/seedPersonal.ts))

### 1.4 Known environment blockers

| Blocker | Symptom | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Node < 20.19 | `vite build` errors with "Vite requires Node.js version 20.19+ or 22.12+" | Upgrade Node; dev server still runs on 20.16 |
| Missing rolldown native binding (win32-x64) | `vite build` errors with "Cannot find native binding" | Delete `apps/web/node_modules` + `package-lock.json`, then `npm install` |
| Missing `GEMINI_API_KEY` | All organize / chat / redact / publish endpoints 500 | Required — get a key from Google AI Studio |
| Presidio not running | Redaction Pass 1 silently falls back to a basic regex (works, but is less accurate) | Start Presidio via `docker-compose up` in `infra/` |

## 4. MVP feature tests

### 4.1 Authentication & roles  [MVP · PRD §2.1]

**Preconditions**
- API running, seed loaded (§1.3)
- Browser opened on `/` — login page visible

**Steps**
1. Submit empty form → confirm a validation message shows.
2. Submit `litigator@acme.law` / `wrong-password` → confirm an "invalid credentials" error.
3. Submit `litigator@acme.law` / `demo` → confirm redirect to `/capture` (or the personal default route).
4. In DevTools → Application → Local Storage, confirm a JWT token is stored.
5. Open Network tab → make any action → confirm requests carry `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`.
6. Click logout → confirm return to login screen and JWT cleared.
7. Repeat 3–6 with `lead@acme.law` / `demo` and `admin@acme.law` / `demo`.
8. Decode the JWT (jwt.io) → confirm `exp - iat ≈ 86400` (24 hours).

**Expected**
- Each account logs in successfully.
- The TopNav shows the user's display name and role pill (Lawyer / Practice Group Lead / Knowledge Admin) for the matching account.
- All three accounts can navigate Capture, Personal Graph, Team Graph, Chat in MVP — role differences are visual only (PRD §1.2 MVP row).

**Failure mode:** wrong password succeeds, JWT missing from request headers, or logout leaves user signed in.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.1)
- [ ] `litigator@acme.law` / `demo` logs in
- [ ] `lead@acme.law` / `demo` logs in
- [ ] `admin@acme.law` / `demo` logs in
- [ ] Logged-in user sees role-appropriate UI elements (display name + role pill in TopNav)
- [ ] Logout returns to login screen and clears JWT
- [ ] JWT expiry is 24 hours
- [ ] Wrong password rejected with a clear error
- [ ] All API requests carry `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`

---

### 4.2 Text capture + auto-save + organize  [MVP · PRD §2.2.1 + §2.3]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in as `litigator@acme.law`
- On `/capture` with the **Write** tab active ([CaptureView.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/CaptureView.tsx))

**Steps**
1. Title focus is on the title field on mount.
2. Type a title: "Cross-exam tactics — Smith v Jones".
3. Tab to the body field.
4. Type ~3 sentences mentioning a judge name, a client party, and a damages dollar figure.
5. Stop typing for ~600ms. Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → `trellis-personal` → `notes` and confirm a record is present.
6. Watch for "Organizing..." indicator. Wait up to 10s.
7. After organize completes:
   - Entity chips appear with color-coded dots ([organize-panel chips](apps/web/src/views/capture/OrganizePanel.tsx)).
   - If the AI flagged it privileged, a banner reads "Attorney-client privileged content detected" ([TextCapture.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/TextCapture.tsx)).
8. Edit the title slightly → confirm auto-save fires again (debounced).
9. **Force a failure path:** stop the API server. Edit body → confirm "Organization failed" pill + **Retry** button. Restart API, click Retry → confirm pill clears and entities populate.
10. Reload the page → confirm the note is still in the sidebar and the body is intact.

**Failure mode:** auto-save never fires; body lost on reload; organize errors silently (no retry control).

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.2.1 + §2.3)
- [ ] Capture-tab editor opens with focus on the title field
- [ ] Note auto-saves to IndexedDB within ~500ms after typing stops
- [ ] After save, organize pipeline runs (Gemini Pro single call) and entities + classification + privilege flag populate
- [ ] Extracted entities render as color-coded chips (PRD §2.3)
- [ ] Privilege banner shows when `isPrivileged: true`
- [ ] On organize failure, "Organization failed" + Retry button visible (PRD §2.3 edge cases)
- [ ] Retry recovers cleanly
- [ ] Page reload preserves the note

---

### 4.3 Audio capture + transcription + organize  [MVP · PRD §2.2.2 + §2.3]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in, on `/capture` → **Record** tab ([AudioCapture.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/AudioCapture.tsx))
- Microphone permission granted in the browser

**Steps**
1. Click the round record button. If permission was not yet granted, accept the browser prompt.
2. Confirm: recording-state UI shows a duration counter and a waveform (WaveSurfer) animating ([AudioCapture.tsx:25-34](apps/web/src/views/capture/AudioCapture.tsx#L25-L34)).
3. Speak for ~10–20 seconds — include a judge name, an opposing-counsel firm, and a procedural term ("motion in limine", "Rule 403", etc.).
4. Click **Stop recording**.
5. Confirm "Transcribing..." state.
6. When transcript appears, confirm it is editable (textarea).
7. Click **Save note**.
8. Confirm the note appears in the sidebar and the organize pipeline runs (entity chips populate inside the note view).
9. Verify the audio blob is retained — DevTools → IndexedDB → `notes` → find the new note → `audioBlob` is present and `contentType === 'audio'`.
10. **Cap test:** start a new recording, leave it running until the counter approaches 5:00. Confirm recording auto-stops within 1 second of 5:00 ([AudioCapture.tsx:39-43](apps/web/src/views/capture/AudioCapture.tsx#L39-L43)).

**Failure mode:** transcript is empty or hallucinated, audio blob not stored, no organize pipeline run after save, recording exceeds 5 min cap.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.2.2 + §2.3)
- [ ] Record button is visible on the Record tab
- [ ] Recording shows duration counter and waveform indicator
- [ ] Stop finalizes recording and triggers transcription
- [ ] Transcribed text is editable before save
- [ ] Original audio is stored in IndexedDB (`audioBlob` non-empty) and the note has `contentType: 'audio'`
- [ ] Maximum recording is capped at 5 minutes (auto-stops)
- [ ] After save, the organize pipeline runs and entities populate
- [ ] On organize failure, an error pill is shown and dismissable

---

### 4.4 Image capture + vision + organize  [MVP · PRD §2.2.3 + §2.3]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in, on `/capture` → **Upload** tab ([ImageCapture.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/ImageCapture.tsx))
- A PNG/JPG of a whiteboard or handwritten note, ≤ 10 MB, on hand

**Steps**
1. **Drag** the file onto the drop zone. Confirm the file is accepted.
2. Repeat using the **Click to upload** path with the keyboard (focus the zone, press Enter or Space → file picker opens, then select).
3. Confirm preview image appears, then "Analyzing image..." state.
4. When extracted text appears, confirm it is editable.
5. Click **Save note**. Confirm:
   - Note saves with `contentType: 'image'` and `imageBlob` present in IndexedDB.
   - Organize pipeline runs on the extracted text (entities populate).
6. **Negative paths:**
   - Try uploading a `.gif` → error "Only PNG, JPG, and WebP files are accepted."
   - Try uploading an 11 MB file → error "File must be under 10MB."
   - Try uploading while still in `analyzing` state → second upload is ignored ([ImageCapture.tsx:27-29](apps/web/src/views/capture/ImageCapture.tsx#L27-L29)).
7. After upload, click **Dismiss** on the error pill → confirm it clears.

**Failure mode:** non-accepted MIME passes; oversize file passes; analysis result not editable; image blob not retained.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.2.3 + §2.3)
- [ ] Drop zone accepts PNG, JPG, WebP
- [ ] Files > 10 MB rejected with a clear error
- [ ] Non-image files rejected with a clear error
- [ ] Uploaded image preview is shown
- [ ] Gemini Vision call produces extracted text and a brief structural description
- [ ] Result is editable before save
- [ ] Original image is stored in IndexedDB and displayed inline
- [ ] After save, the organize pipeline runs and entities populate
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility on drop zone (Enter / Space opens file picker)

---

### 4.5 Entity chips — AI extraction, manual remove, manual add  [MVP · PRD §2.3 acceptance]

**Preconditions**
- A saved text note with body ≥ 20 chars exists and has been organized (entity chips visible)

**Steps**
1. In the in-note chip list ([TextCapture.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/TextCapture.tsx)), hover one chip → "×" button visible.
2. Click "×" → chip disappears immediately and the note in IndexedDB no longer lists that entity.
3. In the **Organize panel** ([OrganizePanel.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/OrganizePanel.tsx)) click **Add** → fill in the AddEntityForm with a new entity (e.g., a witness) → submit.
4. Confirm:
   - New chip appears in the panel.
   - Note's `organizeProvenance.entities === 'user'` (DevTools → IndexedDB).
5. Click "×" on the new chip in the panel → confirm it is removed AND its dedup key is added to `dismissedEntityKeys` so the next organize run doesn't re-add it ([noteStore.dismissEntity](apps/web/src/store/noteStore.ts)).
6. Re-trigger organize (edit the body) → confirm the dismissed entity does NOT come back.

**Failure mode:** chip removal does not persist; dismissed entities re-appear after re-organize; manual add fails silently.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.3 acceptance)
- [ ] Each entity chip has a working "×" remove control
- [ ] Removal persists to IndexedDB
- [ ] Lawyer can manually add a new entity via the Organize panel
- [ ] Dismissed entities do not reappear on next organize run (`dismissedEntityKeys` honored)
- [ ] Privilege flag toggle (Organize panel) persists with provenance `'user'`

---

### 4.6 Personal graph view  [MVP · PRD §2.4]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in as `litigator@acme.law` (seeded notes present, plus any notes created during the test pass)
- Navigate to `/graph` ([PersonalGraphView.tsx](apps/web/src/views/graph/PersonalGraphView.tsx))

**Steps**
1. Confirm graph renders within 2 seconds.
2. Visually count: there should be a node for each note and entity. Colors match design §2.5 (insight purple, matter teal, party magenta, lawyer steel-blue, etc.).
3. **Hover** any node → tooltip shows title/summary, connected edges brighten.
4. **Click** a note node → routes to `/capture` with that note active.
5. **Click** an entity node → graph filters to that entity's neighborhood (other nodes fade to 20% opacity).
6. Type in the search box → matching nodes stay opaque, non-matching fade.
7. Clear the search → all nodes return to full opacity.
8. **Empty state:** sign in as a fresh user (no seed) — confirm "Capture your first note" CTA centered.
9. **Performance:** with seed (~10–20 nodes), zoom and pan freely with mouse wheel and drag — no jank.

**Failure mode:** render takes > 2 s; click on node does nothing; search filter mis-matches; empty state missing.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.4)
- [ ] Force-directed layout renders within 2 seconds of load
- [ ] Node coloring matches design-guidelines §2.5
- [ ] Click on a note node opens the note in `/capture`
- [ ] Click on an entity node filters to that entity's neighborhood
- [ ] Hover shows tooltip and highlights connected edges
- [ ] Real-time search filter fades non-matching nodes to ~20% opacity
- [ ] Zoom and pan work via mouse wheel and drag
- [ ] Empty state shows "Capture your first note" CTA when no notes exist

---

### 4.7 Publish flow + redaction + details disclosure + per-redaction restore  [MVP · PRD §2.5 + design §8.1]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in as `litigator@acme.law`
- A personal note exists with body ≥ 1 sentence containing: a real-sounding client name, an opposing party, a dollar amount, and a year
- Presidio is running (otherwise tests should still pass but with weaker PII detection)

**Steps**
1. Open the note in the sidebar → click **Publish to team graph** (sidebar action button or in-note button).
2. Confirm redaction modal opens within 3 seconds.
3. Wait for "Analyzing for redaction..." to disappear and content to load (within 5 s of modal open).
4. Confirm header shows:
   - Title "Publish to team graph"
   - Preservation score: 5-dot bar + percentage + tier color (green ≥60, amber 40–59, red <40)
5. Confirm **left pane** shows the original (read-only) with PII tokens visibly highlighted (amber underline for PII, blue for generalization).
6. Confirm **right pane** shows the sanitized version, editable (contenteditable).
7. **Hover** one PII highlight in the right pane → confirm matching highlight emphasizes in the left pane (hover-paired).
8. Click the **Details** disclosure ([RedactionModal.tsx](apps/web/src/views/publish/RedactionModal.tsx)).
9. Confirm list shows every redaction with:
   - Type badge (PII or Generalized)
   - `original → replacement` shown in monospace
   - Reason line (e.g., "Personally identifying or client-confidential token replaced")
10. Click **Restore** on one PII row → confirm:
    - Row gets dashed border + Re-apply label
    - Right pane re-renders with the original text in that position
11. Click **Re-apply** → confirm the redaction is reinstated.
12. Manually edit a word in the right pane → confirm the **Publish** button remains enabled even if score < 40%.
13. **Threshold test:** if score > 40% and you have not edited or rejected, Publish is enabled. If score ≤ 40% and you have not edited or rejected, Publish is disabled. Verify both conditions.
14. Click **Publish**.
15. Confirm:
    - Toast: "Published. Your colleagues can now see this."
    - The personal note's sidebar row shows a "Published" indicator.
    - Navigating to `/team` shows a new insight node.
16. Press Escape on a fresh redaction modal — confirm it closes.

**Failure mode:** modal does not open within 3 s; details disclosure missing or wrong shape; Restore does not actually restore the text; Publish enabled below threshold with no edit + no rejection; published note does not appear in team graph.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.5 + design §8.1)
- [ ] Modal opens within 3 seconds of clicking Publish
- [ ] Both passes (Presidio + Gemini generalization) complete within 5 seconds total
- [ ] Side-by-side diff: left read-only original, right editable sanitized
- [ ] PII redactions visually marked on both sides with paired colors
- [ ] Hovering one highlight emphasizes its pair on the other side
- [ ] Preservation score visible with green/amber/red tier and percentage
- [ ] Details disclosure lists every redaction with type, original, replacement, reason
- [ ] Per-redaction Restore button reverts that redaction in the right pane
- [ ] Re-apply re-tokenizes that redaction
- [ ] Publish disabled when score ≤ 40% AND no edits AND no rejections
- [ ] Manual edit OR rejection unlocks Publish even below 40%
- [ ] After publish, new insight node appears in team graph
- [ ] Toast confirmation displayed
- [ ] Personal note marked `isPublished: true` in IndexedDB
- [ ] Escape key closes the modal

---

### 4.8 Team graph view  [MVP · PRD §2.6]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in as any of the three demo accounts
- Navigate to `/team` ([TeamGraphView.tsx](apps/web/src/views/team/TeamGraphView.tsx))

**Steps**
1. Confirm graph renders with all seeded insights + their connected entities.
2. Visual: same color palette as personal graph (design §2.5).
3. **Click** any node → summary panel slides in showing title, type badge, summary, and connected nodes.
4. Confirm the panel shows **summary only** for non-admin (no full body / no edit affordance) — MVP simulates the V1 admin-only full-clickability rule.
5. Close panel (× or click outside).
6. Search filter works as in personal graph.
7. **Empty-state test (requires fresh DB):** drop the seed → confirm "No published insights yet. Be the first to publish."

**Failure mode:** click on node opens full editor (V1 leakage); search filter does not work; empty state missing or wrong copy.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.6)
- [ ] Force-directed layout renders the seeded team graph (≥ 15 nodes)
- [ ] Node coloring matches design-guidelines §2.5
- [ ] Click on a node opens a summary panel (not full note)
- [ ] All three role accounts can view the team graph
- [ ] Search filter behaves identically to personal graph
- [ ] Empty-state copy: "No published insights yet. Be the first to publish."

### 4.9 Chat with team brain — stream, citations, confidence, sources, refusal  [MVP · PRD §2.7]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in
- Navigate to `/chat` ([ChatView.tsx](apps/web/src/views/chat/ChatView.tsx))

**Steps**
1. **Welcome state:** confirm welcome heading + 4 suggested-query buttons render.
2. Click a suggested query → it is submitted as if typed.
3. **Normal query:** type "What strategies work for cross-examining expert witnesses on damages?" → press Enter.
4. Within 500 ms, confirm:
   - Input disabled
   - Chat content dims to ~30% opacity
   - Query-overlay graph fades in (see §4.10 for full overlay test)
5. Within 3 seconds, streaming response begins. Confirm:
   - Streaming cursor visible at the end of the partial text
   - Citation chips appear inline as segments stream in (monospace `[1]`, `[2,3]` form, [CitationChip.tsx](apps/web/src/views/chat/CitationChip.tsx))
6. After streaming completes:
   - Confidence badge pill below the assistant bubble (High / Medium / Low / Insufficient)
   - For High-confidence: Sources panel collapsed by default. For Medium/Low: expanded by default ([SourcesPanel.tsx](apps/web/src/views/chat/SourcesPanel.tsx)).
7. **Click a citation chip** → NodeSummaryPanel slides in from the right with the cited node's summary.
8. Close panel.
9. **Refusal test:** type a query that has no chance of matching the seed, e.g. "What's our firm's stance on maritime salvage tariffs?" → submit.
10. Confirm:
    - Response renders the exact refusal copy: *"I don't have firm knowledge that directly addresses this. You may want to capture your own thinking on this topic as a starting point."*
    - Refusal bubble is styled distinctly (solid bubble + italic muted text, no dashed border)
    - Confidence pill reads "Insufficient"
    - Sources panel is NOT shown (refusal has no fake sources)
    - A "Capture your thinking on this" CTA button appears

**Failure mode:** streaming never starts; citations don't link to nodes; refusal includes fake sources; confidence pill missing.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.7)
- [ ] Query submission triggers overlay within 500 ms
- [ ] Streaming response begins within 3 seconds of query submission
- [ ] Citation chips render inline in monospace `[n]` form and resolve to correct nodes
- [ ] Clicking a citation chip opens NodeSummaryPanel for that node
- [ ] Confidence badge displays High / Medium / Low / Insufficient
- [ ] Sources section is collapsed for high-confidence answers, expanded for medium/low
- [ ] Refusal triggers when no nodes match above the similarity threshold
- [ ] Refusal text matches PRD §2.7.4 exactly
- [ ] Refusal has NO sources panel
- [ ] Refusal shows the "Capture your thinking on this" CTA
- [ ] Suggested queries on welcome state submit correctly

### 4.10 Query-overlay graph animation — Hero Moment 3  [MVP · PRD §2.7 + design §8.3]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in, on `/chat`
- Team graph populated (seed loaded)

**Steps**
1. Submit a query that will match seeded insights (e.g., the canonical damages-expert query).
2. Within 150 ms, confirm chat content dims to ~30 % opacity and input is disabled.
3. Within 400 ms, confirm a full-screen overlay fades in with backdrop blur. The team graph renders centered.
4. Within 1–2 seconds, confirm cited nodes pulse to full opacity one by one, ~150 ms apart, in order of relevance ([QueryOverlay.tsx](apps/web/src/views/chat/QueryOverlay.tsx)).
5. Confirm edges between cited nodes illuminate to `accent-primary` (orange).
6. Overlay holds for ~1 second after all cited nodes are lit.
7. As Gemini begins streaming the response, confirm the overlay fades out over ~600 ms and chat un-dims.
8. **Reduced-motion test:** in OS settings, enable "reduce motion". Reload, re-run a query → confirm pulse animation is replaced with an instant set-to-final-state and the overlay fades but does not blur.
9. **Escape dismissal:** during the overlay, press Escape → confirm overlay dismisses early.

**Failure mode:** overlay does not appear; pulse waves drop frames; reduced-motion preference ignored; Escape does not dismiss.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.7 + design §8.3)
- [ ] Chat dims to ~30 % opacity within 150 ms
- [ ] Overlay backdrop fades in over ~400 ms with blur
- [ ] Team graph renders centered with cited nodes initially at low opacity
- [ ] Cited nodes pulse to full opacity at ~150 ms intervals in relevance order

### 4.11 Seed data integrity + canonical demo query  [MVP · PRD §2.8]

**Preconditions**
- Fresh seed run completed (§1.3 passed)

**Steps**
1. Run §1.3 SQL checks — all must pass.
2. Sign in as `litigator@acme.law`.
3. Confirm 5–8 pre-seeded personal notes appear in the sidebar ([seedPersonal.ts](apps/web/src/lib/seedPersonal.ts)).
4. Go to `/team` — confirm ≥ 15 nodes render.
5. Go to `/chat` — submit **exactly** this query:

   > **What has our firm learned about cross-examining expert witnesses on damages calculations?**

6. Confirm:
   - The query-overlay animation pulses 3+ cited nodes.
   - The streaming response cites at least one of: "Cross-examining damages experts on counsel-supplied assumptions", "Daubert-style challenge to damages expert methodology", "Preparing for expert rebuttal on damages calculations" ([seed/insights.ts:177-211](apps/api/src/seed/insights.ts#L177-L211)).
   - Confidence reads **High** (3+ sources above 0.80).
   - Response is coherent and grounded — no obvious hallucinations.
   - Total time from submit to streaming complete is under 10 seconds.

**Failure mode:** canonical query returns Insufficient; no damages-expert insights cited; response cites hallucinated content.

**Acceptance** (PRD §2.8)
- [ ] Seed script is idempotent (re-running does not duplicate)
- [ ] All three demo accounts can log in and see appropriate populated state
- [ ] Lawyer account has 5–8 personal notes pre-seeded
- [ ] Team graph has 15–30 insights covering judge tendencies, opposing counsel, motion practice, expert witness, settlement, procedural
- [ ] The canonical damages-expert query produces a strong, cited, grounded response
- [ ] Canonical query end-to-end completes in < 10 seconds

## 5. Shipped-beyond-spec tests

These features are in the codebase but not in the PRD. Users will touch them during the demo, so they must work.

### 5.1 Folder create / expand / move notes  [Shipped]

**Preconditions**
- Signed in, sidebar expanded

**Steps**
1. Click **+ New** → **New Folder** ([SideNav.tsx](apps/web/src/components/SideNav.tsx)).
2. Type a folder name, press Enter → confirm folder appears in sidebar.
3. Press Escape on the input mid-type → confirm folder is NOT created.
4. Click a folder header → confirm chevron toggles between right and down; expanded state shows child notes.
5. Click **+ New** → **New Note** → confirm a blank note opens in `/capture`.
6. Use `moveNoteToFolder` programmatically or drag-and-drop (if implemented) to file the note. (If only programmatic API exists, verify via DevTools console: `useNoteStore.getState().moveNoteToFolder(noteId, folderId)`.)
7. Reload → folder + filed note persist.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Create-folder inline input appears and accepts a name
- [ ] Pressing Enter commits the folder
- [ ] Pressing Escape cancels without creating
- [ ] Folders persist across reload (`folders` object store)
- [ ] Expanded/collapsed state toggles by header click
- [ ] Folder shows child-note count when expanded

---

### 5.2 Right-click delete (note + folder) with team-graph cascade  [Shipped]

**Preconditions**
- A personal note exists that has been published (so it has `publishedNodeId`)
- A folder exists with ≥ 1 child note

**Steps**
1. **Right-click the published note** in the sidebar.
2. Confirm context menu appears at cursor with a single **Delete** entry (red destructive styling) ([ContextMenu.tsx](apps/web/src/components/ContextMenu.tsx)).
3. Click outside the menu → confirm it closes.
4. Right-click again → click **Delete**.
5. Confirm modal opens with title "Delete this note?" and the message includes the warning *"This note was published to the team graph — its team-graph entry will also be removed."* ([ConfirmModal.tsx](apps/web/src/components/ConfirmModal.tsx)).
6. Press Escape → confirm modal closes without deleting.
7. Right-click → Delete → click **Delete** in the modal.
8. Confirm:
   - Note removed from sidebar
   - Toast: "Note deleted and removed from team graph."
   - In `/team` view, the corresponding node is gone (and its edges, via the `ON DELETE CASCADE` constraint).
9. **Unpublished note path:** delete an unpublished note → confirm message has no "team graph" warning; toast is just "Note deleted."
10. **Folder delete:** right-click a folder with N child notes → Delete → modal copy mentions "The N notes inside will be kept and moved to Unfiled." → confirm.
    - Folder removed from sidebar.
    - Child notes still present in sidebar at the unfiled level.

**Forbidden-cross-tenant test (optional, advanced):**
1. Sign in as `litigator@acme.law` → publish a note → confirm node owner is the litigator.
2. Sign out, sign in as `lead@acme.law`.
3. Open DevTools and call `fetch(\`/api/team-graph/nodes/<litigator-node-id>\`, { method: 'DELETE', headers: { Authorization: \`Bearer \${jwt}\` } })`.
4. Confirm 403 Forbidden — non-admin cannot delete others' nodes ([routes/teamGraph.ts](apps/api/src/routes/teamGraph.ts)).
5. Repeat as `admin@acme.law` → confirm 200 OK.

**Failure mode:** Delete leaves the team-graph node behind; folder delete also deletes children unexpectedly; lawyer can delete another lawyer's node.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Right-click on a note row opens a portal-rendered context menu at cursor position
- [ ] Right-click on a folder header opens the same menu
- [ ] Context menu auto-closes on outside click, Escape, or scroll
- [ ] Clicking Delete opens a confirmation modal
- [ ] Confirmation modal warns when a note was published to the team graph
- [ ] Confirming deletes from IndexedDB
- [ ] When the note was published, the team-graph node is also deleted (cascading its edges)
- [ ] Folder delete keeps child notes and unfiles them; modal copy explains this
- [ ] Lawyer/Practice Group Lead can only DELETE team-graph nodes they contributed (403 otherwise)
- [ ] Knowledge Admin can DELETE any team-graph node

---

### 5.3 `[[Wikilinks]]` + Backlinks panel  [Shipped]

**Preconditions**
- Two notes exist: A ("Judge Reyes — cross-exam style") and B ("Daubert challenges")

**Steps**
1. Open note A.
2. In the body, type: `See related [[Daubert challenges]]`.
3. Save (auto-save).
4. Reload the note → confirm the `[[Daubert challenges]]` text renders as a clickable WikilinkChip ([WikilinkChip.tsx](apps/web/src/components/WikilinkChip.tsx)).
5. Click the chip → confirm navigation to note B.
6. **Backlinks panel:** while on note B, confirm a "Backlinks (1)" panel shows ([BacklinksPanel.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/BacklinksPanel.tsx)) with a snippet of note A.
7. Click the backlink card → return to note A.
8. **Stub creation:** in note A, type `[[Brand new concept]]` → save → click the unresolved chip → confirm a new stub note titled "Brand new concept" is created and opened.
9. Rename note B's title to "Daubert Standard" → confirm note A's wikilink chip now displays the updated label ("Daubert Standard") on next render.

**Failure mode:** wikilink doesn't resolve after rename; click on unresolved chip does nothing; backlinks panel doesn't update when a wikilink is added.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] `[[X]]` syntax in note body is parsed and rendered as a chip
- [ ] Clicking a resolved chip navigates to the target note
- [ ] Clicking an unresolved chip creates a stub note and navigates to it
- [ ] Backlinks panel lists notes that link to the current note
- [ ] Backlinks panel shows a contextual snippet (±75 chars around the link)
- [ ] Rename of the target note updates the chip label

---

### 5.4 Organize panel — Apply AI, accept suggestions, revert snapshot  [Shipped]

**Preconditions**
- An organized note exists with at least one entity, a classification, and a privilege flag

**Steps**
1. Open the note → confirm the right-side Organize panel ([OrganizePanel.tsx](apps/web/src/views/capture/OrganizePanel.tsx)) is visible (or expand it from collapsed state).
2. Click **Add** entity → fill the form → submit → confirm the chip appears with `provenance: 'user'`.
3. In the Classification section, click an alternative classification → confirm it updates with `provenance: 'user'`.
4. Toggle the privilege flag → confirm it persists.
5. Edit the body significantly → click **Apply AI** (or the panel's organize trigger).
6. Confirm AI may suggest a different classification / privilege — those appear as accept/dismiss controls.
7. Click **Accept** on a suggestion → confirm it applies.
8. Click **Dismiss** on another → confirm it stays at user value.
9. Click **Revert** (snapshot revert) → confirm prior organize state is restored (`restoreOrganizeSnapshot` in [noteStore.ts](apps/web/src/store/noteStore.ts)).
10. Use the panel's **Insert link** action — open LinkQuickPick, select a note → confirm `[[Note title]]` is inserted into the note body at cursor.

**Failure mode:** suggestions never appear; revert does not actually restore; manual changes get overwritten by AI run.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Manual entity add via AddEntityForm works and is marked `provenance: 'user'`
- [ ] Manual classification change persists with user provenance
- [ ] Manual privilege toggle persists with user provenance
- [ ] Apply AI surfaces suggestions (classification / privilege) when AI disagrees with user
- [ ] Accept suggestion replaces the user value
- [ ] Dismiss suggestion keeps the user value
- [ ] Revert restores the prior organize snapshot
- [ ] LinkQuickPick inserts a `[[wikilink]]` at cursor

2. Hover → confirm it turns danger-red.
3. Click → confirm chat clears to the welcome state, citations and overlay state reset.
4. Confirm the button is disabled while streaming.

**Acceptance**
- [ ] Reset button visible on `/chat` when messages exist
- [ ] Click clears messages, citations, sources panel
- [ ] Button is disabled during streaming
- [ ] Welcome state + suggested queries re-render after reset

## 10. V1 / V2 / OUT — not tested

These items are documented for traceability but are **not** under test. Reviewers should verify the items in the "Expected absence" column to confirm they have NOT leaked into MVP.

| Feature | Scope | Expected absence in MVP |
